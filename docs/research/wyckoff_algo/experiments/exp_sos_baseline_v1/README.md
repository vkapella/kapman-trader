# Experiment: SOS Baseline (exp_sos_baseline_v1)

- SOS (Sign of Strength) marks bullish strength emerging after accumulation in Wyckoff terms.
- This experiment is event-only: all SOS events are retained with no sequencing, qualification, or filtering.
- Purpose: provide a clean SOS baseline to compare against AR, Qualified AR, and any AR → SOS sequencing ideas.
- Reads raw detector output; detection logic is unchanged.
- Outputs mirror other experiments and are for research comparison only.
- Not intended as a trading signal without additional sequencing/validation.
