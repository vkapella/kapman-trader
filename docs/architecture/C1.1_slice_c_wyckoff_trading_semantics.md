Wyckoff Structural Signals — Trading Usage Specification

Document Type: Architectural Guidance
Status: Approved (Research-Validated, Production-Confirmed)
Scope: Trading Decision Support, AI Agent Planning, Signal Semantics

⸻

1. Purpose

This document defines the approved, statistically supported usage of Wyckoff events, event sequences, regimes, and regime transitions within the KapMan trading system.

It translates research-validated structure into actionable trading semantics suitable for:
	•	Human decision support
	•	AI agent inputs
	•	Deterministic rule evaluation
	•	Strategy selection and risk management

This document explicitly distinguishes predictive signals from contextual information, based on empirical forward-return and win-rate analysis.

⸻

2. Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

Wyckoff signals have forward-looking value only when treated as path-dependent structure.

Accordingly:
	•	Ordered sequences and event-confirmed transitions are primary signals
	•	Static regimes and isolated events are contextual only

This principle is enforced throughout this document.

⸻

3. Signal Taxonomy

All structural information falls into one of four classes:
	1.	Events (atomic, time-local)
	2.	Event Sequences (ordered, path-dependent)
	3.	Regimes (stateful context)
	4.	Regime Transitions (state change, event-confirmed)

Only some classes are eligible for direct trading actions.

⸻

4. Event Sequences — Primary Trading Signals

4.1 Definition

An event sequence is a deterministic, ordered set of Wyckoff events occurring without violation of structural constraints.

Examples:
	•	SC → AR → ST → SPRING → SOS
	•	SPRING → TEST → SOS
	•	BC → AR_TOP → SOW
	•	SEQ_ACCUM_BREAKOUT

4.2 Statistical Standing

Event sequences demonstrate:
	•	Highest forward returns
	•	Highest directional win rates
	•	Lowest instability across horizons
	•	Strong consistency across benchmark and production

They are the strongest predictive construct in the system.

⸻

4.3 Approved Trading Uses

Trading Activity	Sequence Role
Entry	Primary trigger
Exit	Primary trigger
Scale In / Add	Confirmation after initial entry
Scale Out	Late-stage warning sequences
Strategy Selection	Direction + aggressiveness


⸻

4.4 Directional Interpretation

Bullish sequences (Accumulation resolution):
	•	Long calls
	•	Call spreads
	•	CSPs (early structure)
	•	Add-on entries after SOS

Bearish sequences (Distribution resolution):
	•	Long puts
	•	Put spreads
	•	Covered call exits
	•	Hedge activation

⸻

5. Event-Confirmed Regime Transitions — High-Value Signals

5.1 Definition

A regime transition is actionable only when confirmed by a qualifying event.

Examples:
	•	Accumulation → Markup confirmed by SOS
	•	Distribution → Markdown confirmed by SOW

Regime labels alone are insufficient.

⸻

5.2 Statistical Standing

Event-confirmed transitions:
	•	Outperform static regimes
	•	Outperform regime changes without events
	•	Encode transfer of control (supply ↔ demand)

⸻

5.3 Approved Trading Uses

Trading Activity	Transition Role
Directional Bias	Primary
Entry Confirmation	Required
Position Sizing	Increase confidence
Market Tone Assessment	Structural trend


⸻

5.4 Explicit Rule

A regime transition MUST NOT be used as a trade trigger unless an event confirms it.

⸻

6. Individual Events — Conditional Signals Only

6.1 High-Energy Events (Contextual Edge)

These events have value only within late-stage structure:
	•	SPRING
	•	SOS
	•	SOW
	•	BC (warning only)

They must not be used as standalone trade triggers.

⸻

6.2 Low-Energy Events (Context Only)
	•	AR
	•	ST
	•	TEST (without prior Spring)

These provide structural context only.

⸻

6.3 Approved Uses

Use Case	Event Role
Early Warning	Yes
Risk Management	Yes
Confirmation	Yes
Standalone Entry	No
Standalone Exit	No


⸻

7. Regimes — Contextual, Not Predictive

7.1 Definition

Regimes describe state, not direction:
	•	Accumulation
	•	Markup
	•	Distribution
	•	Markdown
	•	Unknown

7.2 Statistical Standing

Static regimes:
	•	Show weak forward bias
	•	Exhibit high variance
	•	Lag meaningful turning points

⸻

7.3 Approved Uses

Use Case	Regime Role
Strategy Filtering	Yes
Exposure Management	Yes
Risk Framing	Yes
Entry / Exit Trigger	No


⸻

8. Scale-In / Scale-Out Semantics

8.1 Scale-In (Add Risk)

Permitted when:
	•	Initial entry was sequence-driven
	•	A confirming event occurs (e.g., SOS after entry)
	•	No structural contradiction is present

⸻

8.2 Scale-Out (Reduce Risk)

Triggered by:
	•	Late-stage bearish sequences
	•	High-energy counter-events
	•	Event-confirmed opposing transitions

⸻

9. Market Tone & Portfolio Context

Market tone should be derived from aggregate structure, not price levels.

Recommended inputs:
	•	Count and density of bullish vs bearish sequences
	•	Distribution of event-confirmed transitions
	•	Ratio of Accumulation resolutions vs Distribution resolutions

This supports:
	•	Net exposure decisions
	•	Hedge activation
	•	Strategy mix (directional vs premium)

⸻

10. Explicitly Disallowed Uses

The following are not permitted as trade decision drivers:
	•	Regime alone
	•	Event counts without order
	•	Event density without outcome conditioning
	•	Stability metrics without direction
	•	Unordered event sets

These may be logged, displayed, or used diagnostically — but not for decisions.

⸻

11. AI Agent Integration Guidance

11.1 Recommended Structured Inputs

AI agents should receive:
	•	Active sequences (canonical IDs)
	•	Sequence completion status
	•	Event-confirmed transitions
	•	Current regime + prior regime
	•	High-energy event flags
	•	Confidence / energy scores

⸻

11.2 Expected Agent Outputs

Agents may:
	•	Propose strategies
	•	Recommend entries/exits
	•	Suggest scale adjustments
	•	Assess market tone

Agents must not invent signals outside the approved semantics.

⸻

12. Architectural Status
	•	Research algorithm: Validated
	•	Production implementation: Fidelity confirmed
	•	Forward metrics: Exact match on aligned keys
	•	Structural edge: Confirmed in sequences and transitions

This document reflects approved system behavior.

⸻

13. Change Control

Any modification to:
	•	Sequence definitions
	•	Event semantics
	•	Transition rules

requires updated statistical validation and an amendment to this document.
