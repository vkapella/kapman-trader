WINDSURF PROMPT — Instrument Phase A (Options Contract Enumeration)

Task
Instrument Phase A (options contract enumeration) in core/providers/market_data/polygon_options.py so that exactly one INFO-level log is emitted when the first contracts page is successfully fetched for a symbol.

Scope
	•	File: core/providers/market_data/polygon_options.py
	•	Method: PolygonOptionsProvider.list_option_contracts
	•	Phase: Contract enumeration via /v3/reference/options/contracts

Requirements
	•	Emit one INFO log per symbol per run, only after the first successful page fetch.
	•	Do not add additional INFO logs beyond this single event.
	•	Preserve existing DEBUG logs.
	•	Do not log full URLs with query strings or API keys.
	•	Do not change behavior, pagination, filtering, retries, or return values.

Log Content (INFO)
The INFO log should clearly answer: “Phase A has started making progress for this symbol.”

Include the following structured fields (via extra=):
	•	stage: "provider"
	•	phase: "contracts_enumeration"
	•	symbol: underlying ticker (e.g., "AAPL")
	•	page: page number (must be 1)
	•	page_results: number of contracts returned on page 1
	•	expired: boolean value of the expired parameter
	•	limit: requested page size

Placement
	•	Emit the INFO log immediately after the first page is fetched and parsed (page_results available), before pagination continues.
	•	Ensure the log fires only once, even if pagination continues across many pages.

Guarding
	•	Use a local boolean guard (e.g., logged_first_page = False) scoped to the method invocation.
	•	The INFO log must not repeat on retries or subsequent pages.

Acceptance
	•	Running options ingestion for a single symbol produces:
	•	One INFO log indicating Phase A first page fetched
	•	Subsequent progress reported only by existing heartbeat logs
	•	No per-page INFO spam
	•	No secrets or query strings appear in logs
