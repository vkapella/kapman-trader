You are working inside an existing, stabilized Wyckoff research pipeline.
DO NOT refactor or modify any existing detector, baseline, or qualified AR code.
Your task is to ADD ONE NEW EXPERIMENT ONLY.

Context (read carefully):
- Raw detector output already exists at:
  docs/research/wyckoff_algo/outputs/raw/events.parquet
- Baseline AR experiment exists and is LOCKED.
- Qualified AR experiment exists and is LOCKED.
- Experiments are symmetric and must never chain outputs.
- All experiments read from outputs/raw/events.parquet.
- Benchmarks and CSV/Parquet writing are already implemented and must be reused.

Objective:
Implement a new experiment called "SPRING → AR Entry" that emits an ENTRY signal
ONLY when an AR occurs shortly after a SPRING for the same symbol.

This experiment is intended to improve 20-bar returns relative to baseline AR
while maintaining lower MAE than baseline.

================================================================================
REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

1) DIRECTORY STRUCTURE (MUST MATCH EXACTLY)

Create a new directory:

docs/research/wyckoff_algo/experiments/exp_spring_ar_entry/

Containing exactly:

- run.py
- filter.py
- config.yaml
- signal_class.json
- README.md

Do NOT modify any other experiment directories.

================================================================================
2) FILTER LOGIC (CORE REQUIREMENT)
================================================================================

Implement the following logic in filter.py:

Input:
- events_df: DataFrame loaded from outputs/raw/events.parquet
- ohlcv_by_symbol: already loaded by shared runner code
- config: parsed config.yaml

Logic (per symbol, ordered by bar_index or event_date):

- Identify all SPRING events
- For each SPRING:
    - Find the FIRST AR that occurs AFTER the SPRING
    - Only consider it valid if:
        AR.bar_index - SPRING.bar_index <= spring_to_ar_max_bars
- Emit ONLY the AR event (not the SPRING)
- Each AR can be matched to only ONE SPRING
- Resulting events must:
    - event == "AR"
    - role == "ENTRY"
    - direction == "UP"

NO volatility filters.
NO ATR filters.
NO lookbacks beyond sequencing.
NO modification to detection logic.

================================================================================
3) CONFIGURATION
================================================================================

Create config.yaml with exactly:

experiment_id: exp_spring_ar_entry_v1
source_events: ../../outputs/raw/events.parquet
watchlist: ../../data/watchlist_105.txt

spring_to_ar_max_bars: 15

================================================================================
4) SIGNAL CLASS CONTRACT
================================================================================

Create signal_class.json with the following intent:

- signal_id: SPRING_AR_ENTRY_V1
- family: WYCKOFF
- source_event: AR
- intent: early_structural_confirmation
- description: AR entry signal confirmed by prior SPRING within a short window
- primary_horizon: 20
- secondary_horizons: [40]
- expected behavior:
    - better 20-bar mean return than baseline AR
    - lower MAE than baseline AR
    - lower frequency than baseline AR
- promotion_status: EXPERIMENTAL
- version: 1

This file is a CONTRACT for future MVP use. Treat it as read-only.

================================================================================
5) RUNNER AND OUTPUTS
================================================================================

- run.py must mirror the structure of existing experiment run.py files
- It must:
    - Load raw events from outputs/raw/events.parquet
    - Apply filter.py
    - Write outputs to:

      docs/research/wyckoff_algo/outputs/exp_spring_ar_entry/

    - Write BOTH:
        - events.parquet
        - events.csv
        - benchmark_results.parquet
        - benchmark_results.csv

- Reuse the existing benchmark evaluator EXACTLY
- Horizons must include: 5, 10, 20, 40
- Do not modify benchmark math

================================================================================
6) README (SHORT, CLEAR)
================================================================================

README.md must explain:

- What SPRING → AR represents in Wyckoff terms
- Why AR (not SPRING) is used as the entry
- That this experiment adds temporal structure, not thresholds
- That baseline and qualified AR remain unchanged

================================================================================
7) NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
================================================================================

- DO NOT change:
    - runner/run_detector.py
    - outputs/raw/
    - experiments/baseline/*
    - experiments/exp_qualified_ar/*
- DO NOT introduce chaining between experiments
- DO NOT tune parameters beyond spring_to_ar_max_bars
- DO NOT refactor shared utilities
- DO NOT add new dependencies

================================================================================
8) SUCCESS CRITERIA (FOR HUMAN REVIEW)
================================================================================

The experiment is considered successful if benchmark_results show:

- 20-bar mean return >= baseline AR
- MAE <= qualified AR
- signal_count >= 20

If these criteria are NOT met, DO NOT tune further.
Stop and report results.

================================================================================
DELIVERABLE
================================================================================

Produce all files listed above, fully implemented, with clean, readable code.
Assume the environment is already configured correctly.
