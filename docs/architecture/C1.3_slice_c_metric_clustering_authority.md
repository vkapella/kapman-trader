KapMan Metric Clustering & Decision Authority Table

(Authoritative, post-freeze)

⸻

CLUSTER 1 — STRUCTURAL TREND STRENGTH

Decision stage: TA qualification of Wyckoff
Primary question: Does this market have the ability to trend?

Metric	Use	Authority	Notes
ADX	PRIMARY	Confidence ±	Core trend strength signal
DMI + / −	Supporting	Explanatory	Directional context only
MA slope / separation	Supporting	Explanatory	Redundant with ADX
Trend regime classifier	Supporting	Confidence ±	OK if already normalized

Rules
	•	Only ADX may directly modify confidence.
	•	ADX < threshold → downgrade Wyckoff continuation confidence.
	•	ADX strong → allow continuation and scale-in logic.

⸻

CLUSTER 2 — MOMENTUM STATE

Decision stage: Timing & entry quality
Primary question: Is momentum accelerating, stable, or failing?

Metric	Use	Authority	Notes
Momentum slope / accel	PRIMARY	Confidence ±	Cleanest signal
MACD	Supporting	Explanatory	Highly correlated
RSI slope	Supporting	Explanatory	Divergence only
RSI level	Ignore	—	Never decision-grade

Rules
	•	Only momentum slope affects confidence.
	•	Momentum divergence → force conservative alternatives.
	•	MACD/RSI explain why, never score.

⸻

CLUSTER 3 — PRICE VOLATILITY (REALIZED)

Decision stage: Timing, size, DTE bias
Primary question: How violently does price move?

Metric	Use	Authority	Notes
Bollinger Band width	PRIMARY	Strategy bias	Compression / expansion
ATR	Supporting	Size / DTE	Redundant with BB width
Historical Volatility	Supporting	Explanatory	Context only
VSI	Supporting	Explanatory	Noise measure

Rules
	•	BB width sets compression vs expansion state.
	•	Compression + Wyckoff → better asymmetry.
	•	Expansion → downgrade late entries.

⸻

CLUSTER 4 — PRICE EXTREMITY

Decision stage: Entry risk & overextension
Primary question: Is price stretched relative to recent norms?

Metric	Use	Authority	Notes
BB position (%B)	PRIMARY	Timing veto	Overextension
RSI level	Supporting	Explanatory	Never reversal trigger

Rules
	•	Extremity does not flip direction.
	•	Extremity forces:
	•	smaller size
	•	spreads over longs
	•	or WAIT alternatives

⸻

CLUSTER 5 — OPTIONS VOLATILITY REGIME

Decision stage: Strategy class authority
Primary question: Is premium cheap or expensive?

Metric	Use	Authority	Notes
IV Rank / Percentile	PRIMARY	Strategy FORBID	Hard constraint
IV Term Structure	Supporting	DTE floor	Shape matters
IV Skew	Supporting	Structure bias	Call vs put

Rules
	•	Extreme IV forbids long premium as primary.
	•	Must offer long-premium alternative at lower confidence.
	•	Term structure sets minimum DTE.
	•	Skew biases spreads.

⸻

CLUSTER 6 — EXPECTED MOVE & PRICING

Decision stage: Size & patience
Primary question: Is the move already priced in?

Metric	Use	Authority	Notes
Expected Move	PRIMARY	Size / WAIT	Pricing realism
EM vs Wyckoff target	Supporting	Explanatory	Asymmetry check

Rules
	•	If expected move ≥ structural target → downgrade or WAIT.
	•	Never used for direction.

⸻

CLUSTER 7 — DEALER FLOW REGIME

Decision stage: Timing veto & precision
Primary question: Will options mechanics fight this trade?

Metric	Use	Authority	Notes
Gamma Flip	PRIMARY	TIMING VETO	Highest authority
Net GEX	Supporting	Regime bias	Amplify vs dampen
GEX slope	Supporting	Momentum bias	Secondary
DGPI	Supporting	Explanatory	Context only

Rules
	•	Gamma flip proximity → WAIT / NO_TRADE primary.
	•	Does not invalidate thesis.
	•	Forces defensive alternatives.

⸻

CLUSTER 8 — DEALER STRUCTURAL LEVELS

Decision stage: Strike & target refinement
Primary question: Where will price stall or accelerate?

Metric	Use	Authority	Notes
Primary call / put walls	PRIMARY	Strike anchors	Decision-grade
Wall clusters	Supporting	Targeting	Profit zones
Open interest maps	Supporting	Explanatory	Context

Rules
	•	Never initiate into a wall.
	•	Walls define targets and spread widths.
	•	Used only when dealer data exists.

⸻

CLUSTER 9 — META / CONFIDENCE

Decision stage: Explanation & audit
Primary question: Why is confidence high or low?

Metric	Use	Authority	Notes
Metric confidence flags	Supporting	Explanatory	Transparency
Data availability	Supporting	Explanatory	No inference

Rules
	•	Missing data = “not computed”, never bearish/bullish.
	•	Agent must explicitly list missing clusters.

⸻

HARD GLOBAL RULES (LOCKED)
	1.	One metric per cluster may affect confidence or rules.
	2.	All other metrics are explanatory only.
	3.	Dealer metrics may veto timing, not thesis.
	4.	Volatility may forbid strategy classes.
	5.	TA may propose alternatives, never override Wyckoff.

⸻

What this enables immediately

With this table frozen, we can now:
	1.	Build the confidence-scoring math (no ambiguity)
	2.	Assign Rule IDs cleanly
	3.	Generate agent prompts that cannot double-count indicators
	4.	Backtest decision logic, not indicator soup
