Below is the reference Wyckoff market cycle schematic:

       Price ↑
               |                      
   MARKUP PHASE
               |                 Breakout above Accumulation Resistance
               |                 ↑ Higher highs & higher lows
               |                 Volume expands on up moves
               |        
     ─────────────────────────────────────  Markup begins
               |
DISTRIBUTION   |      Range after previous uptrend
Phase A        |   PSY → BC → AR → ST follow range boundaries
Phase B        |   Weak rallies, failure to rally above BC
Phase C        |   UTAD (Upthrust after Distribution)
               |   Test back into range
               |   Last Point of Supply (LPSY)
     ─────────────────────────────────────  Distribution Range Support
ACCUMULATION   |
Phase A        |   PS → SC → AR → ST (bottom range)
Phase B        |   Range building; price sideways
Phase C        |   Spring / Shakeout below support
               |   Test of Spring (recovery)
               |  
     ─────────────────────────────────────  Accumulation Range Resistance
               |
   MARKDOWN PHASE
               |                 Breakdown below Distribution Support
               |                 ↓ Lower lows & lower highs
               |                 Volume expands on down moves

Here is the OHLCV summary along with other metrics.   Ignore the embedded Wyckoff assessment when conducting your assessment.  Instead, conduct you assessment according to the schematic and to the OHLCV and related data provided.   

RULE 1: If price is sideways after a downtrend with tests of support and absorption signatures → Accumulation.

RULE 2: If price breaks above the Accumulation resistance with volume expansion → Markup.

RULE 3: If price is range-bound near prior highs with failure to extend and frequent test failures → Distribution.

RULE 4: If price breaks below Distribution support with volume expansion → Markdown.

Provide:
- Best matching Wyckoff phase
- Supporting evidence from price & volume behavior
- Which schematic events are most visible in this data
-Compare your assessment with the embedded Wyckoff assessment.
