Hard rules:

* Your entire response MUST be a single, continuous file
* Do NOT emit multiple Markdown blocks
* Do NOT use fenced code blocks
* Do NOT split content into sections across responses
* Do NOT include commentary, explanations, apologies, or meta-text
* Everything you output must be safe to paste as-is into Windsurf
