STORY
A8.1 — Remove max_spread_pct From Dealer Metrics Runtime Behavior

OBJECTIVE
Completely remove bid/ask spread–based filtering from A3 dealer metrics.
After A8 refactoring, bid and ask data is no longer authoritative and must not
influence eligibility, filtering, or confidence.

Mathematically:
bid == ask
Spread == 0
Spread-based logic is invalid.

OPTION SELECTED
Option A (Preferred): Remove flag entirely.

HARD CONSTRAINTS
• No schema changes
• No silent behavior changes
• Deterministic output must be preserved
• Do not refactor unrelated logic
• Preserve existing metric semantics (GEX, walls, gamma flip, slope)

SCOPE OF REMOVAL (MANDATORY)
You must remove ALL of the following:

1. CLI / Runtime
   • Remove --max-spread-pct CLI argument
   • Remove default value
   • Remove help text
   • Remove validation logic
   • Remove propagation into config / runtime objects

2. Filtering Logic
   • Remove spread-based exclusion entirely
   • Eliminate:
     - spread_pct calculations
     - bid/ask comparisons
     - spread-derived diagnostics
   • wide_spread must never appear as a filter reason

3. Diagnostics / Logging
   • Remove:
     - wide_spread counters
     - spread-related diagnostics
     - spread mentions in DEBUG logs
   • Update diagnostic summaries to exclude spread entirely

4. Tests
   • Remove or update tests referencing:
     - max_spread_pct
     - bid/ask spread logic
   • Ensure tests still pass with bid/ask NULL
   • Add/adjust test asserting:
     - Missing bid/ask does NOT invalidate contracts

5. Documentation / Help
   • Remove references from CLI help text
   • Remove references from README / docs if present

WHAT MUST REMAIN
• min_open_interest filter
• min_volume filter
• gamma availability filter
• DTE filtering
• All GEX, wall, slope, and position calculations

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER CHANGE
• Dealer metrics produce VALID output even when:
  - bid IS NULL
  - ask IS NULL
• No contracts are excluded due to spread
• Confidence may still be invalid for other legitimate reasons
• Logs and diagnostics contain no reference to spread

DEFINITION OF DONE
• grep for "spread" returns no runtime logic references
• No CLI flag named max-spread-pct exists
• Dealer metrics run successfully on Polygon-only data
• All tests pass
• No WARN or ERROR related to bid/ask

FINAL INSTRUCTION
Implement exactly this change.
Do not introduce new flags.
Do not replace spread logic with placeholders.
Favor deletion over substitution.
