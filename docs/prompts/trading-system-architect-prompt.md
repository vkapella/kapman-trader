# 📝 **Trading Decision-Support System – Architecture & Roadmap Prompt Template**

Use this prompt **as-is**, filling in the blanks.
It is designed to allow ChatGPT to act as your **consultant, systems architect, and product strategist** to produce a full requirements document, EPIC roadmap, and MVP plan.

---

## **1. Business Context**

* **Business name (if any):**
* **Team members and roles:**
* **Target users (just me / partner / external traders):**
* **Primary market focus (options / equities / AI stocks / swing trades / etc.):**

---

## **2. Current State**

* **Brief summary of what I’ve already built:**
* **What works today:**
* **What does *not* work / main pain points:**
* **Technical stack so far (Python, Replit, GitHub, APIs used, DBs, etc.):**

---

## **3. Vision**

* **Ultimate goal for the system (1–2 sentences):**
* **What I want the system to do automatically:**
* **What I want the system to recommend:**
* **What decisions the system should *not* make:**

---

## **4. MVP Goal (usable by me & partner by Dec 31, 2025)**

* **Minimum functionality needed for daily use:**
* **Data sources required:**
* **Core workflows (e.g., daily job, scanning list, scoring, dashboards):**
* **Must-have vs Nice-to-have:**

---

## **5. Requirements (list freely; ChatGPT will structure them)**

Examples: Wyckoff, automated scanner, option alignment, volatility overlays, scoring engine, dashboards.

**My list of requirements:**
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

(Add as many as needed.)

## **6. Constraints**

* **Budget constraints:**
* **Time constraints:**
* **Technical constraints:**
* **Data/latency constraints:**

---

## **7. Architectural Preferences**

* **Where I want to run it (local, Replit, Fly.io, etc.):**
* **Preferred architecture (microservices, monolith, event-driven, etc.):**
* **Frontend preference:**
* **Desired level of automation (low / medium / high):**

## **8. Output I Want From ChatGPT**

(Check all that apply.)

* [ ] System architecture diagrams
* [ ] MVP requirements list
* [ ] Roadmap: Epics → Increments → Tasks
* [ ] Data model + API schema
