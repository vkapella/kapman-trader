✅ KapMan Trade Decision Framework — DECISIONS FROZEN

The following points are now authoritative and will be treated as non-negotiable constraints for all subsequent work (metric clustering, scoring math, agent prompts).

⸻

1️⃣ Wyckoff vs TA authority (FINAL)

Rule: Wyckoff has veto authority over trading.
	•	If Wyckoff says NO_TRADE, then:
	•	Primary recommendation = NO_TRADE
	•	Confidence is high (because structure is authoritative)
	•	TA:
	•	Always qualifies Wyckoff (strengthens or weakens confidence)
	•	May propose a TA-based trade as the first alternative
	•	That alternative is explicitly lower confidence than the Wyckoff NO_TRADE

This locks the hierarchy as:

Wyckoff decides whether trading is allowed.
TA decides whether an alternative thesis is compelling enough to mention.

Wyckoff never becomes an alternative to TA.
TA never overrides Wyckoff as primary.

2️⃣ Volatility authority (FINAL)

Rule: Extreme IV forbids long-premium trades as primary.
	•	When IV is extreme:
	•	Long-premium strategies are forbidden as primary
	•	Primary must be:
	•	defined-risk, or
	•	NO_TRADE
	•	A long-premium countervailing play is still required:
	•	Offered as an alternative
	•	Explicitly lower confidence
	•	With clear conditions under which it would improve

This gives volatility hard constraint power on strategy class, while still preserving informational completeness.

⸻

3️⃣ Dealer authority (FINAL)

Rule: Dealer veto blocks timing, not thesis.
	•	Dealer veto results in:
	•	Primary = WAIT / DEFER / NO_TRADE
	•	With explicit timing-based rationale
	•	Directional thesis remains valid
	•	A dealer-safe alternative trade must be offered, for example:
	•	further DTE
	•	more defined risk
	•	hedge or partial expression

Dealer metrics:
	•	cannot flip direction
	•	can block “now”
	•	can force defensiveness

This is exactly the right level of authority for dealer data.

⸻

4️⃣ Confidence scoring philosophy (FINAL)

Rule: Confidence is strictly relative.
	•	Confidence scores are meaningful only within the recommendation set
	•	The highest confidence recommendation is always the primary
	•	Alternatives:
	•	must have lower confidence
	•	must explicitly state why they are lower
	•	A blocked trade with high confidence (e.g., Wyckoff NO_TRADE) outranks:
	•	speculative alternatives
	•	“interesting but premature” setups

This ensures:
	•	consistent ranking
	•	clean scoring
	•	no false precision across symbols or time

⸻

5️⃣ NO_TRADE semantics (FINAL)

Rule: NO_TRADE is first-class and scorable.
	•	NO_TRADE:
	•	has a confidence score
	•	participates in ranking
	•	may be the highest-confidence outcome
	•	Alternatives:
	•	must still be offered when reasonable
	•	must be discrete, scorable, and ranked
	•	NO_TRADE is not a failure state — it is a positive recommendation

This enforces discipline and prevents over-trading bias.

🔒 What is now LOCKED

We will not revisit the following unless you explicitly reopen them:
	•	Authority ordering: Wyckoff → TA → Volatility → Dealer (with defined veto scopes)
	•	Primary vs alternative semantics
	•	Relative (not absolute) confidence
	•	NO_TRADE as first-class output
	•	Mandatory alternatives when trades are blocked

All future work must implement these decisions — not reinterpret them.

▶️ What comes next (cleanly sequenced)

Now that decisions are frozen, the next steps are purely implementation planning, not philosophy.

Next Step 1 (recommended)

Build the full metric clustering table, explicitly mapping:
	•	each metric → cluster
	•	which clusters can affect confidence
	•	which clusters can veto or constrain
	•	which metrics are explanatory only

This will be fast and rigorous now that authority is fixed.

Next Step 2

Design the confidence-scoring math that:
	•	respects cluster boundaries
	•	enforces relative ranking
	•	prevents double counting
	•	encodes your veto rules deterministically
